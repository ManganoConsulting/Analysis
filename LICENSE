This repository retains the licensing terms that govern the original MATLAB
application. The original project ships with "License Instructions.docx" in the
repository root; those terms continue to apply to the new Python sources added
as part of the PySide6 migration. Consult that document (or contact the project
maintainers) for full licensing details.
