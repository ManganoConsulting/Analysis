Purpose: Remove the visible scroll panel from the tool ribbon.

Summary of changes
- Updated embedded CSS in the ribbon HTML to hide/disable scrollbars.
- Files modified:
  1) +UserInterface/+StabilityControl/@ToolRibbon/ToolRibbon.m
     - In buildRibbonHtml(), CSS changed:
       - Set `overflow: hidden` on `html, body`.
       - Added `-ms-overflow-style: none;` and `scrollbar-width: none;`.
       - Added WebKit rule `::-webkit-scrollbar { width:0; height:0; display:none; }`.
  2) +UserInterface/+StabilityControl/@Main/createToolRibbon.m
     - In buildRibbonHtml(), applied the same CSS changes.

Why this fixes it
- The ribbon is rendered inside a `uihtml` component. Some platforms render a vertical scrollbar by default if any content slightly exceeds the box. Forcing overflow hidden and explicitly disabling scrollbars across engines removes the visual scroll panel while preserving layout.

How to verify
1) Launch the application (or open the main UI).
2) Check the tool ribbon at the top: there should be no vertical scrollbar/scroll panel on the right edge.

If a scrollbar still appears
- It may come from the MATLAB container panel rather than the HTML. As a fallback, after creating `obj.RibbonPanel`, disable scrolling on that panel (if available):
  - If the panel has a `Scrollable` property, set it to `off`.
  - Example placement: where `obj.RibbonPanel` is created in `Level1Container.createView` or `Main.createView`.

Next steps (optional)
- Commit the changes:
  - `git add "+UserInterface/+StabilityControl/@ToolRibbon/ToolRibbon.m" "+UserInterface/+StabilityControl/@Main/createToolRibbon.m" "SESSION_NOTES.md"`
  - `git commit -m "UI: hide scrollbars in ribbon HTML to remove visible scroll panel"`

Notes
- No functional behavior of ribbon commands was changed; only CSS affecting scrollbars.
